🧠 Game Concept
Each player takes turns to:

Roll the dice.

If the roll is not 1, the number is added to their current score.

The player can choose to hold and add the current score to their total score.

If the roll is 1, the player loses their current score, and the turn switches to the other player.

🏆 Winning Condition
The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins the game!

🔄 Rules
Rolling a 1 = lose current score and switch turn.

Rolling 2–6 = add to current score.

Clicking Hold = add current score to total and switch turn.

Clicking New Game = reset all scores and start again.

▶️ How to Play
Click Roll Dice to roll a number between 1 and 6.

Click Hold to keep your current score and end your turn.

Click New Game to restart the game at any time.
